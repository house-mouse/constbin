Super simple utility to create a header and C file tha contain
the contents of a file (or files) as a constant char array.

There are tons of progams to do this but I've found all I've tried lacking...

I really want cmake to "do the right thing" with dependencies, but it doesn't
with a cmake script (that runs at config time not build time) and xxd
would be a strong contender... but it's not universally available and there
are limitations on naming scheme that I don't love.

The main target of this is CMake, so future thoughts are to focus
on macros and usage there, so there isn't a huge consideration for
consistency on the constbin command line arguments as long as an
eventual CMake macro of some sort maintains compatibility
