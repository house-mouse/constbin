There are lots of enhancements that might be nice...

Being able to explicitly name the const array on the command line
would be nice.

The ability to change input directories, potentially after reading
some items from a different directory, might be quite useful.

Appending to an existing output file could be handy.

A CMake macro that does all the "right" things to change directories,
set dependencies, and correctly prefix things would be a good addition.

I begrudgingly admit there may be cases where you do want to add 1 to
the const length and add a trailing null character.

A templating language (perhaps using mustache notation?) wants to
grow out of this in some unique way.

A file walker that recursively walks a tree could be a good thing. (Done)

Creating a map of actual filenames to const values could be useful
as well.
